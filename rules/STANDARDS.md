# Standards

### Runtime Environment

- **Prefer isomorphic code**: Write runtime-agnostic code that works in Node, browser, and workers whenever possible
- **Clear runtime indicators**: When code is environment-specific, add a comment at the top of the file:

```ts
// @env node
// @env browser
```

### Explicitness

Favor explicit, traceable code over implicit "magic". A reader (human or agent) should be able to follow where every name comes from without running tooling.

### Comments

- **Avoid unnecessary comments**: Code should be self-explanatory
- **Explain "why" not "how"**: Comments should describe the reasoning or intent, not what the code does

## TypeScript

TypeScript is infested by landmines, from `Promise` to try-catch blocks.

All steps in problem-solving must be explicit, pure and composable.

### TypeScript Patterns

- Bias for functional programming.
- Colocate code that changes often close together, code that changes together belongs together.
- Compose a program via multiple isolated functions, features are about piping data into the right shape.
- Constructive type modeling: Build the shape so the illegal value can't be constructed.
- Discriminated unions: Model variants with a kind literal discriminant so impossible states can't be represented. No optional-field bags.
- Schema-derived types: Reach for `Pick`/`Omit`/`Parameters`/`ReturnType`/`Awaited`/`typeof` before declaring a new interface.
- Object args: Pass objects, not positional, so argument order is self-documenting. Skip on hot paths (per-frame render, tokenizers, parsers).
- `Type` > `interface`
- `Function` > Arrow functions (`() => {...}`). Arrow functions only used in callbacks. Composing a feature? `Function`, Piping a map? `.map((...) => {...})`
- Prefer small, cohesive modules organized around one primary domain type or concept
- In TypeScript, when a module is centered on a primary type, prefer an OCaml-style namespaced module pattern: `export type X = ...` plus `export const X = { ... } as const` for constructors, parsers, combinators, and other domain operations
- Prefer attaching domain logic to the module for its primary type rather than scattering it across generic utility files
- When a module starts accumulating substantial logic for other types or domains, split those concerns into their own sibling modules
- Prefer specific domain modules over catch-all `utils` files
- `Record<string, unknown>` considered harmful slop. It's slop likely indicative of widening or erasing types and or not parsing types into stronger domain types at IO boundaries.

## Branded types and correct construction

Use branded/refined types when they prevent realistic misuse or invalid construction, especially for:

- IDs: `UserId`, `OrgId`, `WorkflowId`
- parsed strings: `EmailAddress`, `NonEmptyString`, `Url`
- constrained numbers: `PositiveInt`, `Cents`, `Percentage`
- units: `Milliseconds`, `Bytes`, `UsdCents`

Construct branded values through parsers or smart constructors. Avoid passing raw strings/numbers where a domain type exists.

Avoid optional/null/undefined values in functions that require a value. Push optionality outward. Branch or parse before calling.

Avoid `Partial<T>` as an application/domain input unless partiality is the real domain concept. Prefer explicit input types for each operation.

## State machines and boolean blindness

When an entity has meaningful lifecycle states, model them with tagged unions or equivalent value classes.

Prefer:

```ts
type Invoice =
  | { readonly _tag: "Draft"; readonly id: InvoiceId; readonly lines: NonEmptyArray<LineItem> }
  | { readonly _tag: "Sent"; readonly id: InvoiceId; readonly sentAt: Instant }
  | { readonly _tag: "Paid"; readonly id: InvoiceId; readonly paidAt: Instant };
```

Avoid:

```ts
type Invoice = {
  readonly isSent: boolean;
  readonly isPaid: boolean;
  readonly sentAt?: Date;
  readonly paidAt?: Date;
};
```

Avoid boolean parameters that control behavior:

```ts
createUser(input, true);
```

Prefer named options or domain types:

```ts
createUser(input, { emailVerification: "skip" });
```

Booleans are fine as clear predicate return values:

```ts
isExpired(token): boolean;
hasPermission(user, permission): boolean;
```

## Error Handling

- USE errors as values over throwing exceptions for expected failure paths
- USE `better-result` (`dmmulroy/better-result`) for fallible operations
- USE tagged/structured error types over untyped error strings
- Reserve thrown exceptions for truly exceptional, unrecoverable, or framework-boundary cases
- Propagate errors explicitly; do not swallow them or replace them with success-shaped fallbacks

If the project uses `better-result`, read `~/.dud/rules/BETTER-RESULT.md` for patterns.

### Error Message Design

- Write error messages to help the reader understand and recover: say what happened, why it happened if known, what the impact is, and what to do next
- Prefer specific, concrete wording over vague or generic messages
- If the cause is unknown, say that plainly; do not invent false precision
- State what is still true or preserved, especially whether data, prior work, or system state remain intact
- Include the most useful recovery action or next diagnostic step
- Match detail to audience: user-facing errors should be plain and actionable; internal errors should include precise operational context needed for debugging
- Internal errors should name the failing operation, relevant identifiers, expected vs actual state when useful, and the most likely remediation path

## Sensitive data, telemetry, and debugging

Prefer end-to-end structured tracing across requests, jobs, workflows, application modules, adapters, and external calls.

Tracing/logging should make failures diagnosable with safe fields:

- domain IDs
- operation names
- dependency/provider names
- state tags
- retry counts
- typed error tags
- safe summaries

Do not put secrets in errors, traces, logs, or snapshots.

Use a `Redacted<T>` wrapper for sensitive values such as tokens, API keys, passwords, raw credentials, and secrets. Prefer Effect's `Redacted.Redacted` in Effect codebases or a local shared `Redacted<T>` wrapper.

Wrap sensitive values at the boundary and unwrap only where the raw value is needed, usually inside an adapter making an external call.

## Configuration and resources

Parse environment/config at startup or the earliest boundary into typed config with branded/redacted values where appropriate. Return known configuration failures as tagged error values. The composition root should report a safe startup message and terminate rather than treating invalid configuration as an internal defect.

Do not read `process.env` throughout the app. Missing or invalid config is a startup failure with useful, safe context.

Avoid top-level side effects except in true entrypoint/bootstrap files. Modules should not start servers, open connections, read env, register handlers, or perform I/O at import time.

Resource creation and cleanup should be explicit and owned by bootstrap/imperative shell code or Effect layers when using Effect.

Avoid mutable singletons/global state. Constants and pure lookup tables are fine. If a singleton is required by a framework/runtime, isolate it at the boundary.

Inject `Clock` / `Random` services into dependency-bearing modules. Pure domain functions may accept explicit `now` / random values.

## HTTP APIs

Without an error schema, a caller must guess what failed. A structured error lets the caller fix the input and retry with intent.

- Each 4xx and 5xx response has a schema. 429 and 503 responses give `Retry-After` data. 400 responses identify invalid fields.
- All errors use one schema.
- Each error has a machine-readable code. Each schema has a human-readable message.
- Examples do not expose internal details.

Predictable names let callers infer paths safely. Inconsistent names force callers to memorize exceptions and can cause bugs.

- Resource paths use nouns, such as `/users` and `/orders`. Collection paths use plural names.
- All paths use one case. Prefer kebab-case.
- Use HTTP methods, not action verbs in URLs.

## React

**BANNED: `useEffect`**

Direct usage of `useEffect` is BANNED in this codebase. Most `useEffect` usage compensates for something React already provides better primitives for. Banning the hook forces logic to be declarative, predictable, and event-driven, preventing race conditions, infinite loops, and dependency hell. Use a query library (e.g., React Query) for data fetching.

Banning `useEffect` forces cleaner tree design:
- Parents own orchestration and lifecycle boundaries.
- Children can assume preconditions are already met.
- Each unit does one job, and coordination happens at clear boundaries.
